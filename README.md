## Cron scheduling for "nth day" of the month.
When scheduling tasks for specific dates like the 3rd Tuesday or 2nd Friday of the month, there's no direct built-in method available in Cron.
Instead, you'll have to employ shell scripting to accomplish this.

This script will automatically output the line that can be used for the crontab entry.
